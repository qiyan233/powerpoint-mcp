# PowerPoint MCP Server

The best open-source MCP server for PowerPoint automation. Free, no subscriptions, no credits.

Built by a UCSD grad student who was tired of spending 3-4 hours per week making presentations.

## Demo Video

*Watch Claude build a complete "Fourier Transform and Fourier Series" lecture from scratch - equations, diagrams, and animations included.*

## Windows Only

**This MCP server works exclusively on Windows** because it uses `pywin32` COM automation to control the PowerPoint application directly. This is what enables bidirectional read/write access, real-time editing, LaTeX rendering, templates, and animations.

macOS/Linux alternatives like `python-pptx` don't get access to the full PowerPoint feature set. PRs for an AppleScript-based macOS version are welcome.

## Why This Is Different

There are a lot of PowerPoint automation tools out there. Here is why this one is actually worth using:

**Template-first design**
Point the LLM at your desired template and it just works. Tell Claude: *"Make a GPU performance comparison presentation using our company's Nvidia_Black_Green_2025 template"* - it discovers the template, analyzes its layouts, and populates them correctly.

**Actually bidirectional and real-time**
Unlike `python-pptx` (write-only) or other popular MCP implementations, this uses COM automation. Claude can READ your existing presentations and edit them in real time without closing PowerPoint first.

**Multimodal slide analysis**
The `slide_snapshot` tool gives the LLM both visual context (screenshots with annotated bounding boxes) AND detailed text/chart/table extraction. Claude can literally see what is on your slides.

**LaTeX rendering that actually works**
The server renders LaTeX equations by controlling PowerPoint's built-in equation editor directly. Just write `<latex>E=mc^2</latex>` and it appears as a native PowerPoint equation object.

**HTML formatting that saves tokens**
Bold, italic, colors, and bullet points via HTML tags (`<b>`, `<i>`, `<red>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`). One formatting pass, no repeated tool calls to apply fonts and colors separately.

**Animations with progressive disclosure**
Real controllable PowerPoint animations, including paragraph-level entrance effects. Bullet-by-bullet reveals work out of the box - no need to split content across multiple shapes.

**One-line install, no subscriptions**
```bash
claude mcp add powerpoint -- uvx powerpoint-mcp
```
Works with Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or any MCP client. No third-party services, no monthly fees, no expiring credits.

**11 focused tools, not 30+**
LLM decision paralysis is real. Every tool has a clear purpose and sensible defaults so Claude spends time building your presentation, not figuring out which tool to call.

## Real Workflows

These are actual workflows tested in production:

**Research and Create**
> "Research the latest developments in quantum computing, then create a 15-slide presentation on it"

Claude uses web search to find sources, then builds the deck with citations and formatted content.

**Data Analysis and Visualization**
> "Analyze Titanic_dataset.csv, perform a detailed EDA, and make a presentation explaining the findings"

Free-form Python/matplotlib plotting that renders directly into slide placeholders.

**Codebase Documentation**
> "Analyze my entire repository and create a technical architecture presentation"

Claude reads your local files, understands the structure, and generates slides explaining the system.

**Template-Driven Corporate Decks**
> "Use the Nvidia_Black_Green_template to create a Q4 sales presentation from nvidia_quarterly_sales_data.csv"

Template layouts are discovered automatically, placeholders are identified and populated correctly.

**Academic LaTeX Heavy**
> "Make a 20-slide lecture teaching Fourier Series and Fourier Transforms with equations"

Native PowerPoint equation objects rendered from LaTeX, with animations for progressive disclosure.

**Interactive Learning**
> "Help me understand this presentation on PAM and BLOSUM matrices from my Computational Biology course, explain each slide and quiz me after each section"

Claude reads your slides (including charts, tables, and speaker notes), explains the content, and creates an interactive quiz.

## Quick Start

**Step 1: Install**
```bash
claude mcp add powerpoint -- uvx powerpoint-mcp
```

**Step 2: Open PowerPoint**
Open Microsoft PowerPoint (any presentation, or just the blank start screen).

**Step 3: Give Claude a command**
```
Make a 10-slide presentation on machine learning fundamentals using my company template.
Add equations where relevant and animate the bullet points on each slide.
```

That is it. Claude handles the rest.

  "mcpServers": {
    "powerpoint": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["powerpoint-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
3. Restart Trae after configuration and use an MCP-enabled agent mode

### Trae CN
1. Trae CN currently supports the same project-level `.trae/mcp.json` format
2. Add the following to `.trae/mcp.json` in your project root:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "powerpoint": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["powerpoint-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
3. Restart Trae CN after configuration and use an MCP-enabled agent mode such as Builder with MCP / SOLO Coder if available in your build

### Codex

```bash
codex mcp add powerpoint -- cmd /c uvx powerpoint-mcp
```

After adding it, restart Codex CLI or run `/mcp` to verify the server is available.

## Tool Reference

All 11 tools, each with a single clear responsibility:

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `manage_presentation` | Open, close, create, or save presentations. The entry point for any workflow. |
| `slide_snapshot` | Comprehensive slide analysis: screenshot with annotated bounding boxes, text extraction, chart data, table parsing, hyperlinks, comments, and speaker notes. |
| `switch_slide` | Navigate to a specific slide number in the active presentation. |
| `add_speaker_notes` | Add or replace speaker notes on any slide using the official COM approach. |
| `populate_placeholder` | Fill any placeholder with text (HTML formatting), LaTeX equations, or matplotlib plots. |
| `manage_slide` | Duplicate, delete, or move slides within the presentation. |
| `list_templates` | Discover all available PowerPoint templates from Personal, User, and System template directories. |
| `analyze_template` | Analyze a template's layouts with placeholder positions and screenshots. |
| `add_slide_with_layout` | Add a new slide using a specific layout from a template, preserving all template styling. |
| `add_animation` | Add entrance animations (fade, appear, fly, wipe, zoom) to shapes with optional paragraph-level progressive disclosure. |
| `powerpoint_evaluate` | Execute arbitrary Python code in the PowerPoint context for complex batch operations. |

---

## Content Formatting Reference

The `populate_placeholder` tool accepts HTML-style tags for rich formatting:

```
<b>bold text</b>
<i>italic text</i>
<u>underlined text</u>
<red>colored text</red>  (also: blue, green, orange, purple, white, black)
<ul><li>unordered list item</li></ul>
<ol><li>ordered list item</li></ol>
<latex>E = mc^2</latex>
```

For matplotlib plots, pass your plotting code directly as the content with `content_type="plot"` - the server executes it and inserts the resulting image.

---

## How It Works

PowerPoint MCP uses Windows COM automation (`pywin32`) to control Microsoft PowerPoint directly, the same mechanism used by VBA macros and Office add-ins. This gives it full access to every PowerPoint feature: the equation editor, animation engine, template system, and real-time slide reading.

The server is built on [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) and published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/powerpoint-mcp/) for easy installation via `uvx`.

Screenshots are saved automatically to `~/.powerpoint-mcp/` with timestamp-based filenames.

---

## Limitations

- **Windows only**: COM automation is a Windows technology. No macOS or Linux support currently.
- **PowerPoint required**: Microsoft PowerPoint must be installed. LibreOffice is not supported.
- **Python 3.10+**: Required for the server runtime.
